# A_Simple_Game
My first game created using Unity, used to explore the basic functionality of the program. Currently in development.
To play a build of the game, clone the files and run the .exe of your choice under Builds. 
  Notes:
    - New Bulilds will be released when signifigant progress is made
    - The Build Data must be next to the executable in order for the executable to function
